### Card Sounds
Currently, ONLY Card Announcements are available. Please see https://github.com/BoxOfDevs/DO2-Asset-Loader/tree/main/AvgZing%20Decked%20Out%202%20Asset%20Loader%20RP/sounds/do2cards/ for a full list of available sounds. <br>
Cards can be played with /playsound do2.<cardname>, where spaces in the cardname are dots. For example, /playsound do2.adrenaline.rush, /playsound do2.avalanche, or /playsound do2.stumble. <br>
<br>
As of version 1.0.2, sounds only play 16 blocks away and have falloff. This will be adjusted in a future version, but I wanted to get this out sooner than later, particularly as a proof of concept. <br> <br>
These will likely change to play 256 blocks away without falloff, so that they can be triggered by command blocks directly at the card processor -- without needing to transfer the sounds to any centralized processing system.
